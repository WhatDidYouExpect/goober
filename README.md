Discord bot that learns from what people say!

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/gooberinc/goober/wiki)

keep in mind that most of the bot was written at 2am (still is)
this is like way slower then regular goober due to like *tensorflow* so if you want the lightweight markov version of goober switch to master
as of writing this im on epoch 3 im thinking i should train this on a faster machine...
